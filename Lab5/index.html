            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Wei Chen, I was born in Yancheng, Jiangsu Province, China. I live in my town for 10 years and actually that's
                a awesome place for childish time. My family moved to Nanjing,China------the capital in Jiangsu Province
                in 2003 because my dad was admitted as a Master student inã€€Nanjing Agriculture University. My family settled
                down there from 2003 till now. I continued my primary school from 4th grade in Nanjing. After that, I went
                to Middle school, senior high school, and university all in Nanjing. I studied Computer Science in my undergraduate
                period because I'm interested in technology.
            </p>
            <p>
                In August 2016, I went to University of North Dakota for a CS Master Degree. That was the first time for me to go abroad
                and I was curious about everything. After one and a half year studying in UND, I decided to transfer to Stevens
                as I feel Stevens is a more prestigious and advanced university.
